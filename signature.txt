You only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your repository. You
must paste in it the signature of your machine’s virtual disk. Go to Submission and
peer-evaluation for more information.

Since it is a matter of setting up a server, you will install the
minimum of services. For this reason, a graphical interface is of no
use here. It is therefore forbidden to install X.org or any other
equivalent graphics server. Otherwise, your grade will be 0.

DEBIAN
AppArmor for Debian must be running at startup.

You must create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM.

A SSH service will be running on port 4242 only. For security reasons, it must not be
possible to connect using SSH as root.

You have to configure your operating system with the UFW firewall and thus leave only
port 4242 open.

Please note that your virtual machine’s signature may be altered
after your first evaluation. To solve this problem, you can
duplicate your virtual machine or use save state.

No próprio pdf explica em cada sistema operacional como pegar. É por fora da vm. 
Dica da vida: salvar snapshot do estado da máquina quando terminar e tiver 
tudo feito, pra quando você fizer seus testes, avaliações, etc na hora de 
desligar pedir pra voltar praquele estado.
